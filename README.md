# TEMPLATE for PYTHON Developer using PYCHARM

## Introduction
The course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to achieve a specific goal, the goal is usually to hack into a certain system! We'll start by learning how this system work and its weaknesses, then you'll lean how to write a python program to exploit these weaknesses and hack the system. As we write the program I will teach you python programming from scratch covering one topic at a time. By the end of the course you're going to have a number of ethical hacking programs written by yourself (see below) from backdoors, keyloggers, credential harvesters, network hacking tools, website hacking tools and the list goes on. You'll also have a deep understanding on how computer systems work, how to model problems, design an algorithm to solve problems and implement the solution using python.

## Programming topics:

Exceptions.
Serialisation.
Compiling programs to binary executables.
Sending & receiving HTTP requests.
Parsing HTML.
```
- Hacking topics:
```
Basics of network hacking / penetration testing.
Changing MAC address & bypassing filtering.
Network mapping.
ARP Spoofing - redirect the flow of packets in a network.
DNS Spoofing - redirect requests from one website to another.
Spying on any client connected to the network - see usernames, passwords, visited urls ....etc.
Inject code in pages loaded by any computer connected to the same network.
Replace files on the fly as they get downloaded by any computer on the same network.
Detect ARP spoofing attacks.
Bypass HTTPS.
Create malware for Windows, OS X and Linux.
Create trojans for Windows, OS X and Linux.
Hack Windows, OS X and Linux using custom backdoor.
Bypass Anti-Virus programs.
Use fake login prompt to steal credentials.
Display fake updates.
Use own keylogger to spy on everything typed on a Windows & Linux.
Learn the basics of website hacking / penetration testing.
Discover subdomains.
Discover hidden files and directories in a website.
Run wordlist attacks to guess login information.
Discover and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
Discover weaknesses in websites using own vulnerability scanner.
```
- Application in this repo:
```
mac_changer - changes MAC Address to anything we want.

network_scanner - scans network and discovers the IP and MAC address of all connected clients.

arp_spoofer - runs an arp spoofing attack to redirect the flow of packets in the network allowing us to intercept data.

packet_sniffer - filters intercepted data and shows usernames, passwords, visited links ....etc

dns_spoofer - redirects DNS requests, eg: redirects requests to from one domain to another.

file_interceptor - replaces intercepted files with any file we want.

code_injector - injects code in intercepted HTML pages.

arpspoof_detector - detects ARP spoofing attacks.

execute_command payload - executes a system command on the computer it gets executed on.

execute_and_report payload - executes a system command and reports result via email.

download_and_execute payload - downloads a file and executes it on target system.

download_execute_and_report payload - downloads a file, executes it, and reports result by email.

reverse_backdoor - gives remote control over the system it gets executed on, allows us to

Access file system.

Execute system commands.

Download & upload files

keylogger - records key-strikes and sends them to us by email.

crawler - discovers hidden paths on a target website.

discover_subdomains - discovers subdomains on target website.

spider - maps the whole target website and discovers all files, directories and links.

guess_login - runs a wordlist attack to guess login information.

vulnerability_scanner - scans a target website for weaknesses and produces a report with all findings.
```
Acomplishment:
```
As you build the above you'll learn:

Setting up a penetration testing lab to practice hacking safely.

Installing Kali Linux and Windows as virtual machines inside ANY operating system.

Linux Basics.

Linux terminal basics.

How networks work.

How clients communicate in a network.

Address Resolution Protocol - ARP.

Network layers.

Domain Name System - DNS.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP.

HTTPS.

How anti-virus programs work.

Sockets.

Connecting devices over TCP.

Transferring data over TCP.

How website work.

GET & POST requests.

```

- Python 
- Object Oriented Design
- PyCharm IDE

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data-science projects using Python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 
- PyCharm Community IDE: Be More Productive: Save time while PyCharm takes care of the routine. Focus on the bigger things and embrace the keyboard-centric approach to get the most of PyCharm's many productivity features. Get Smart Assistance: PyCharm knows everything about your code. Rely on it for intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes, easy project navigation, and much more.
- Please download open the source folder as a project (right click on the folder that contain main, templates, static, and venv and run as open Python Project using PyCharm).
- PLease download all the necessary packages before run the application. If you use PyCharm, it will take care of your missing package or
```
# or u can use
pip install all-missing-package(replace all-missing-package with the package(packages) that you intend to install)
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running:
* Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) Community Edition.
* [Install Anacoda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you,install%20anaconda-navigator.%20To%20start%20Navigator,%20see%20Getting%20Started.) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Anacoda Navigator yet, here's how to get started.
