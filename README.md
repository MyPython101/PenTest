# Ethical Hacking Using Python

## [LINUX COMMAND LINE](https://www.mediacollege.com/linux/command/linux-command.html)
## Start PyCharm:
```bash
root@kali: cd /opt/pycharm-community-2021.3.1/bin
root@kali: ./pycharm.sh

```
## Navigate to the projectL
```bash
root@kali: cd /PycharmProjects/
```

## Introduction
The goal of the program in this repo is usually to hack into a certain system! 
Start by learning how this system work and its weaknesses, then how to write a 
python program to exploit these weaknesses and hack the system. Application include
 from backdoors, keyloggers, credential harvesters, network hacking tools, website hacking tools

- Learn the basics of website hacking / penetration testing.
- Discover subdomains.
- Discover hidden files and directories in a website.
- Run wordlist attacks to guess login information.
- Discover and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
- Discover weaknesses in websites using own vulnerability scanner.
```
- Application in this repo:
```
- mac_changer - changes MAC Address to anything we want.
- network_scanner - scans network and discovers the IP and MAC address of all connected clients.
- arp_spoofer - runs an arp spoofing attack to redirect the flow of packets in the network allowing us to intercept data.
- packet_sniffer - filters intercepted data and shows usernames, passwords, visited links ....etc
- dns_spoofer - redirects DNS requests, eg: redirects requests to from one domain to another.
- file_interceptor - replaces intercepted files with any file we want.
- code_injector - injects code in intercepted HTML pages.
- arpspoof_detector - detects ARP spoofing attacks.
- execute_command payload - executes a system command on the computer it gets executed on.
- execute_and_report payload - executes a system command and reports result via email.
- download_and_execute payload - downloads a file and executes it on target system.
- download_execute_and_report payload - downloads a file, executes it, and reports result by email.
- reverse_backdoor - gives remote control over the system it gets executed on, allows us to
- Access file system.
- Execute system commands.
- Download & upload files
- keylogger - records key-strikes and sends them to us by email.
- crawler - discovers hidden paths on a target website.
- discover_subdomains - discovers subdomains on target website.
- spider - maps the whole target website and discovers all files, directories and links.
- guess_login - runs a wordlist attack to guess login information.
- vulnerability_scanner - scans a target website for weaknesses and produces a report with all findings.
```
Acomplishment:
```

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data-science projects using Python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 
- PyCharm Community IDE: Be More Productive: Save time while PyCharm takes care of the routine. Focus on the bigger things and embrace the keyboard-centric approach to get the most of PyCharm's many productivity features. Get Smart Assistance: PyCharm knows everything about your code. Rely on it for intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes, easy project navigation, and much more.
- Please download open the source folder as a project (right click on the folder that contain main, templates, static, and venv and run as open Python Project using PyCharm).
- PLease download all the necessary packages before run the application. If you use PyCharm, it will take care of your missing package or
```
# or u can use
pip install all-missing-package(replace all-missing-package with the package(packages) that you intend to install)
```
