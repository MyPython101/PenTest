# Penetration Testing and Ethical hacking

## Overview

This project explores ethical hacking techniques using Python, focusing on system vulnerabilities and how to exploit them in a controlled, educational manner. The project demonstrates tools like backdoors, keyloggers, credential harvesters, network hacking utilities, and website exploitation scripts.

**Disclaimer:** This project is intended for educational purposes. Always ensure that you have permission before attempting to hack any system.

## Getting Started

This section helps you set up your environment for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for testing Python scripts.
- **Anaconda Navigator:** Manages Python environments and packages.
- **PyCharm IDE:** A powerful tool to write, test, and debug Python code.
- **Kali Linux:** (Optional) A Linux distribution designed for penetration testing.

### Installation

1. **Install missing Python packages** using:
   ```bash
   pip install <package-name>
   ```
   PyCharm will also prompt you to install any missing packages automatically.

2. **Launch PyCharm:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/pycharm-community-2021.3.1/bin
   ./pycharm.sh
   ```

3. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /PycharmProjects/
   ```

## Hacking Topics

This project explores a wide range of ethical hacking topics:
- **Network Hacking:** Learn techniques such as MAC spoofing, ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and packet sniffing.
- **Website Penetration Testing:** Discover subdomains, run wordlist attacks, and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Malware Development:** Develop tools like keyloggers, backdoors, and trojans to evade antivirus detection.

## Tools in This Repository

- **mac_changer:** Changes MAC address to a specified value.
- **network_scanner:** Scans a network for connected devices.
- **arp_spoofer:** Redirects network traffic through ARP spoofing.
- **packet_sniffer:** Captures sensitive data (passwords, URLs) from intercepted network traffic.
- **dns_spoofer:** Redirects DNS requests to malicious domains.
- **reverse_backdoor:** Provides remote control over a compromised system.
