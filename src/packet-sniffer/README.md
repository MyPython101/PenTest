## Tools:
- Using the scapy package to capture information on the HTTP layer

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import scapy.all as scapy
from scapy.layers import http # scapy.layers has it own http class


def sniff(interface):
    scapy.sniff(iface=interface, store=False, prn=process_sniffed_packet)

```
- the packet.haslayer(layer-wanted)
- scapy doesnt has its own http layer so we need to import http package from scapy.layers
- other layers: [Raw](data that communicate),[Ethernet],[IP],[TCP],[HTTP 1],[HTTP Request]
```python
# the packet.haslayer(filter out all the layer)
def process_sniffed_packet(packet):
    # check if the packet has a http layer
    # check against http
    if packet.haslayer(http.HTTPRequest):
        # put another filter to get only username and password
        if packet.haslayer(scapy.Raw):
            print(packet.show())


sniff("eth0")
```
